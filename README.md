# STOR-390-Final-Midterm
This repository will contain my midterm and my final project for STOR 390 at the University of North Carolina. The midterm will be my proposal for the paper I wish to cover in my final paper. 

The final paper will go over an analysis of the methods performed in the paper I use from the midterm. It will also feature an analysis of a philosophical concern that is also outlined in the midterm. I will flesh this out more once the final paper is further along.
